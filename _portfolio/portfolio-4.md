*Product idea: accessing Wi-Fi without password while maintaining security.*<br/><br/>

**Project Summary**
* Calculated risk scores of IoT devices using machine learning and created a risk profile with their 2FA phone numbers.
* Synthesized a Wi-Fi access dataset and labeled it with clustering algorithms and outlier detection packages in Python.
