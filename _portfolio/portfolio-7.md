*Differnece of attention map between supervised learnign and self-supervised learning.*<br/><br/>

**Project Summary**
* Implemented two self-supervised learning frameworks, SimCLR and Rotnet, for image recognition tasks.
* Built linear classifiers for the two self-supervised learning methods and compared their performance with supervised learning.
