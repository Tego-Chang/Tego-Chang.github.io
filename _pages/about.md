> *What I have experienced all lead me to the field where I will be excellent!*

That is what I have believed since my graduation from my **first M.S. in Communication Engineering** 10 years ago. That also has driven me to diverse positions and fields in the first decade of my career – from a **software engineer**, a **product manager**, to a **data scientist** and from the field of **IoT** to **Big Data and AI**.

# Software Engineer for IoT (2012 ~ 2014)

## Realtek
How are those invisible signals transmitted in the air? To pursue the answer to the question, I started my career as a software engineer for Wi-Fi Routers. I studied wireless protocols and validated the behaviors for 10+ SoC models to pass the certifications of Wi-Fi 4 and 5. 

# Product Manager for IoT, Analytics, and AI SaaS (2015 ~ 2020)

## Synology
How a circuit board with chips becomes a consumer product with fancy shells? The desire to broadly explore the business of IoT drove me to become a software product manager for Wi-Fi routers. I planned various software features for RT1900ac and RT2600ac, with the latter [ranked no.1 router](https://www.smallnetbuilder.com/wireless/wireless-reviews/synology-rt2600ac-router-reviewed/) by SmallNetBuilder.

## Netgear
How could I plan a software roadmap based on numbers, instead of just feeling? That was my concern until I joined the company and acted as an engineering product manager in analytics. I designed 5+ projects to collect engineering and marketing data and extracted insights for the executives’ business decision-making. 

## Foxit Software
Big Data is not just extracting insights from BI reports, but it can be further integrated into products to help people directly. To realize that, I led a team to build a contract review automation service from scratch, [iDox.ai](https://idox.ai).

# Data Scientist at Duke University (2021 ~ Present)

Being a product manager in AI is not enough – I want to get my hands dirty. That motivates me to pursue my **second M.S. in Data Science**. Since then, I start to **leverage my previous domain knowledge to make more business impact in diverse fields**.

## TeleSign
I applied Wi-Fi domain knowledge, Machine Learning skills, and product management mindset to validate a PoC project and proposed a new business line in IoT to the CTO. 

## 2nd Order Solutions
I investigated the state-of-the-art explainable ML and presented the outcome in a way absorbable for the general audience in the financial credit advisory field. 

# The Journey still Goes On and On and On and On!

I am continuing leveraging my abilities to generate more values for the industry. If that also excites you, feel free to reach out! Perhaps we could achieve something different!
