> *What I have experienced will lead me to a field where I would be excellent!*

That is what I have believed since my graduation from the first M.S. 10 years ago. During the first decade of my career, my passion for the high-tech industry has led me to diverse positions and fields â€“ from a software engineer, product manager, to a data scientist; from the field of IoT to Big Data and AI.
