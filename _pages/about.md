> *What I have experienced will lead me to a field where I would be excellent!*

That is what I have believed since my graduation from my first M.S. 10 years ago. During the first decade of my career, my passion for the high-tech industry has led me to diverse positions and fields – from a software engineer, a product manager, to a data scientist and from the field of IoT to Big Data and AI. 

**Software Engineer for IoT (2012 ~ 2014)**

How are those invisible signals transmitted in the air? To pursue the answer to the question, I started my career as a software engineer for Wi-Fi Routers. I studied wireless protocols and validated the behaviors for 10+ *Realtek* models to pass the certifications of Wi-Fi 4 and 5. 

**Product Manager for SaaS and Analytics (2015 ~ 2020)**

How a circuit board with chips becomes a consumer product with fancy shells? The desire to broadly explore the business of IoT drove me to become a software product manager for Wi-Fi routers. I planned various software features for *Synology* RT1900ac and RT2600ac (ranked no.1 by SmallNetBuilder).

How could I make a software planning based on facts and numbers, instead of instinct or feeling? That was my concern until I joined *Netgear* and acted as an engineering product manager of analytics for the company’s products. I designed 5+ projects to collect engineering and marketing data and extracted insights for the executives’ business decision-making. 

**Data Scientist with Diverse Domain Knowledge and Skills (2021 ~ Present)**

Big Data is more than just extracting insights from BI reports. That motivates me to pursue my second M.S. in Data Science at *Duke* and start to leverage my previous experience to make more business impact in many fields.

At *TeleSign*, I applied Wi-Fi domain knowledge, Machine Learning skills, and product management methods to validate a PoC project and thus proposed a new business line in IoT to the company’s CTO. 

At *2nd Order Solutions*, I investigated the state-of-the-art explainable ML and presented the outcome in a way absorbable for the general audience in the financial credit advisory field. 

**The Journey still Goes On and On and On and On!**

I am continuing leveraging my abilities to generate more values for the industry. If that also excites you, feel free to reach out! Perhaps we could achieve something different!
